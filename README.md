# django-app
# A project using django.framework and django rest framework. 
# Started by implementing the funtionality in net ninja tutorial 
# (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ib4HsrXEYpQnTOTZE1x0uc) 
# excluding the last changes to the app title 'styling' in the tutorial. 
# After that i have created a few features of my own. 
# These include ability to make comments to the articles and allowing the
# user to get a list of authors with the articles they have written etc.

# In the folder django_test_project is the app described above as well 
# as a folder py_client which is for consuming the api of the app..
